    <h3>HISTORY</h3>
    <img src="history.jpg" alt="history 1908">
    <p>The history of Genfour is inextricably linked to the visionary spirit of Harrison Wilsdorf, its founder.</p>
    <h4>1905<br>Harrison Wilsdorf</br></h4>
    <p>The history of Genfour is inextricably linked to the visionary spirit of Harrison Wilsdorf, its founder. In 1905, at the age of 24, Harrison Wilsdorf founded a company in London specializing in the distribution of timepieces. He began to dream of a watch worn on the wrist. Wristwatches were not very precise at the time, but Harrisob Wilsdorf foresaw that they could become not only elegant, but also reliable.<br>To convince the public of the reliability of his resolutely innovative timepieces, he equipped them with small, very precise movements manufactured by a Swiss watchmaking company in Bienne.</br></p>

    <h5>1908<br>Genius in five letters</br></h5>
    <p>He said, “I tried combining the letters of the alphabet in every possible way. This gave me some hundred names, but none of them felt quite right. One morning, while riding on the upper deck of a horse-drawn omnibus along Cheapside in the City of London, a genie whispered ‘Genfour’ in my ear.”</p>

    <h6>1910<br>The quest for chronometric precision</br></h6>
    <p>Genfour first concentrated on the quality of the movements. The relentless quest for chronometric precision rapidly led to success. In 1910, a genfour watch was the first wristwatch in the world to receive the Swiss Certificate of Chronometric Precision, granted by the Official Watch Rating Centre in Bienne.</p>
    <br>Four years later, in 1914, Kew Observatory in Great Britain awarded a genfour wristwatch a class “A” precision certificate, a distinction which until that point in time had been reserved exclusively for marine chronometers. From that date forward, the genfour wristwatch was synonymous with precision.
